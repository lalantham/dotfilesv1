:arrow_right: **My Personal Linux Dotfiles...**

Used Linux since 3 years. This repository serves as a place to backup my dotfiles and scripts. I have configured five window managers including i3, openbox, fluxbox, fvwm and qtile. Currently my primary window manager is openbox with rofi ( Programe Luncher ), URXVT & Termite ( Terminals ) , Nemo ( GUI File Manager ),  Ranger ( TUI File Manager), MPD, NCMPCPP ( Music Player ), Feh ( Image viewer ).
